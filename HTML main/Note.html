What is HTML?
HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages).
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
A markup language is a set of markup tags
HTML documents are described by HTML tags
Each HTML tag describes different document content

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

All HTML documents must start with a type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.


All HTML elements can have attributes
The HTML title attribute provides additional "tool-tip" information
The HTML href attribute provides address information for links
The HTML width and height attributes provide size information for images
The HTML alt attribute provides text for screen readers
At W3Schools we always use lowercase HTML attribute names
At W3Schools we always quote attributes with double quotes

Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.
Search engines use your headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
h1 headings should be main headings, followed by h2 headings, then the less important h3, and so on.

Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
Use background-color for background color
Use color for text colors
Use font-family for text fonts
Use font-size for text sizes
Use text-align for text alignment

Use the HTML <a> element to define a link
Use the HTML href attribute to define the link address
Use the HTML target attribute to define where to open the linked document
Use the HTML <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
Use the HTML id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
Use the HTML href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark

Use the HTML <img> element to define an image
Use the HTML src attribute to define the URL of the image
Use the HTML alt attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed
Use the HTML width and height attributes to define the size of the image
Use the CSS width and height properties to define the size of the image (alternatively)
Use the CSS float property to let the image float
Use the HTML <map> element to define an image-map
Use the HTML <area> element to define the clickable areas in the image-map
